# Exercise Sheet 10

## Shorten lock times
- in the STM implementation from the lecture, we locked all TVars in the validating / commit phase and freed them afterward
  - think of a way to shorten the time for which all TVars are locked
  - the solution here was to merge locking and validation of a TVar
  - after we finish validating, we can unlock the read set TVars (although, I argue that we might as well keep them locked so we know for sure they cannot change just before we commit)
  - we then commit and unlock the WS keys

## Transactions in a Key-Value Store
- implement a Key-Value-Store and use it for STM instead of TVars
- need the following functions:
  - `insert(Key,Value)`: overrides an existing entry with the same key
  - `lookup(Key)`
  - `delete(Key)`: successful even if the key does not exist
- here, `insert` is like a `write_tvar`/`new_tvar` rolled into one
- `lookup` is like `read_tvar`
- and `delete` is like a special kind of `write_tvar`
- keep in mind that `delete` can cause the need to stop the suspension of other transactions
- the sample solution locks the entire key_store, but I just keep track of whether or not each individual variable is locked. it's kinda trash but it works
- the lecture used `gb_trees` to do this, but I used a list
- instead of only having the RS and WS, i also added a DS for delete set
  - the DS kept track of all "tvars" that would be deleted in a given transaction
  - note that the WS and DS are mutually exclusive. You cannot have a variable in both the WS and DS at the same time.
  - in the case where you insert a key and value and then delete it later on in the same transaction, that key and value should be transferred from the WS to the DS
  - in the other direction, if you delete a key and value and later want to add it back, you must delete it from the DS and add it to the WS

## Retry without locking
- in the lecture implementation, we lock all TVars in the read set and validating them if a retry happens
- we don't need to do any locking at all; we could simply let the TVars check if the version changed
  - this was pretty easy, just need to add a `check_version` message to be received by the TVars
  - send along the version you currently have and wait for a `restart` message when one of them changes

```erl
    retry    -> RS = keysort(1,get(rs)),
                Me = self(),
                RFWD = spawn(fun() -> restart_forward(Me) end),
                map(fun({TVar,Version}) -> TVar!{check_version,Version,RFWD} end, RS),

                receive
                  restart -> atomically(Trans)
                end;
```

- if the version is the same, we simply add the transaction pid to the list of suspended transactions
- that way when the TVar is changed by a write, all the suspended transactions are notified that they can now try again!
- if the version is not the same, we can send the restart message right away!
