# Lecture 22 and 23

## comparison of optimistic and pessimistic implementation
- possible to run into livelocks in pessmistic implementation (not in optimistic)
- usually more concureency in the optimistic approach
- EXAM: should the number of rollbacks counted in `retry` validation failure be counted in the total number of rollbacks?

Problem in the optimistic implementation:
- consider a situation in which two TVars t1 and t2 are always the same value 
- consider the following transactions

```hs
incTVars t1 t2 = atomically $ do
  v1 <- readTVar t1
  writeTVar t1 (v1+1)
  v2 <- readTVar t2
  writeTVar t2 (v2+1)

dangerous t1 t2 = atomically $ do
  v1 <- readTVar t1
  # here, incTVars commits
  v2 <- readTVar t2
  if v1 != v2 then
    loop
  else 
    return 42
```

- to solve this problem in the optimistic approach, we can modify it so that a commit informs other transactions that they are now invalid
- we will always check whenever we read and write TVars whether we have received an `invalid` message from another transaction committing

Implementation:

- readTVar and writeTVar should always check if the transaction was invalidated by another commit
- same goes for atomically: we should check just before we commit
- validation is not necessary anymore since a transaction is informed if it becomes invalid
- inside the TVars, we will need to store information about all the transactions which read this TVar (similar to the RS, but distributed)
- when writing a new value to a TVar, all non-committed transactions need to be informed about their invalidation

### `stmNotification.erl`
Idea: implement the version of STM where transactions are notified when they become invalid (when another transaction commits).

- whenever we read a TVar, the TVar keeps track of our Pid in a list of Transaction pids
- whenever we write to a TVar we should remove ourself (if we are there) from the list of Pids which have read that TVar
  - the TVar then sends a message to all the Pids in its list that they are now invalid transactions
- thus, the RS no longer needs to keep track of Versions or Values; it will just be a list of TVars
  - thus, we always just return the value returned by `core_read_tvar` in `read_tvar`, and if we don't already have the TVar in our RS, we simply add it


`write_tvar(TVar,V)`
- this stays relatively the same
- we simply add a `receive` at the beginning to check for `invalid` messages

`atomically()`
- if we get a `rollback`, we need to delete ourselves from all the TVars we read
- one we are removed from all of them, we can restart the transaction

# Lecture 23
- we should also check if we are invalid when performing `new_tvar`, sine this can be a step in a transaction too
- instead of validating once we get a Result in `atomically`, we need to check if we have been invalidated (using `receive`)
- in the `retry` case, there is no longer need for validation
  - furthermore, there is no need to enroll suspensions and start a `restart_forward` process
  - we are notified whenever we become invalid
  - and we become invalid whenever a TVar which we have read becomes modified
  - thus, we should simply wait for an `invalid` message 
    - once we receive one, we can free ourselves from the read list (using `free_read(TVar)` and restart the transaction (re-call `atomically(Trans)`
- however, it might be the case that we receive too many invalid messages
  - thus we need to create an `invalid_forward` process
  - furthermore, since we store ourselves in TVars in the `read_tvar` process, we need to store the `invalid_forward` process sort-of globally
  - we can do this easily by storing it in state (ie. `put(invf, spawn(fun() -> invalid_forward....`)
- however, there's STILL a problem
  - locking and sending the invalid messages are not synchronized!
  - because they are sent over two different processes, we could get a lock message first or the invalid message first
