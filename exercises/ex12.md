# Exercise Sheet 12

## Invariants in STM implementations
- add STM invariants to the first optimistic STM implementation
- remember that invariants are a special type of transaction that usually only involves reading TVars and returns a boolean as to whether the invariant holds or was violated
  - eg. all bank account TVars must have a positive balance
- the sample solution creates a store where all invariants are stored
- you can `add` an invariant to the store, or use `get` to receive a list of all invariants
- the BIF `registered()` has a list of all registered atoms in Erlang; we can use it in `add` and `get` to see if the invariant store has already been created
  - if it hasn't and we want to `add`, we need to create it then `add`
  - if it hasn't and we want to `Å‹et`, we should just return `[]`
- lastly, we can make a function `validateInvs()` which runs all of the invariants
  - if all invariants return `true`, then we return `true`
  - if any invariant returns `false`, we return `false`
- we `validateInvs` after we run any transaction and get a result, so just before we commit

## SyncVar
- a SyncVar is a buffer of capacity 0
  - a SyncVar is a synchronization point where two threads exchange a message/value and *both perform a hand shake at that point*.
- implement in Haskell and Erlang (and apparently Python, although there is no sample solution for the Python implementation)

Haskell

```hs
module Sync where

import Control.Concurrent

data SyncVar a = SyncVar (MVar a) (MVar ())

writeSyncVar :: SyncVar a -> a -> IO ()
writeSyncVar (SyncVar v r) a = do
  putMVar v a
  takeMVar r

newSyncVar :: IO (SyncVar a)
newSyncVar = SyncVar <$> newEmptyMVar <*> newEmptyMVar

readSyncVar :: SyncVar a -> IO a
readSyncVar (SyncVar v r) = do
  val <- takeMVar v
  putMVar r ()
  return val

main :: IO ()
main = do
  v <- newSyncVar
  _ <- forkIO $ do
    writeSyncVar v (42 :: Int)
    putStrLn "done"

  threadDelay 1000000
  val <- readSyncVar v
  print val
```

Erlang

```erl
-module(sync).
-export([readSyncVar/1, writeSyncVar/2, newSyncVar/0, test/0]).

newSyncVar() -> spawn(fun() -> sync_var() end).

sync_var() ->
  receive
    {read, PID}     -> sync_var_write(PID);
    {write, V, PID} -> sync_var_read(V, PID)
  end,
  sync_var().

sync_var_read(V, PIDW) ->
  receive
    {read, PIDR} -> PIDR!V, PIDW!written
  end.

sync_var_write(PIDR) ->
  receive
    {write, V, PIDW} -> PIDR!V, PIDW!written
  end.

readSyncVar(Var) -> Var!{read, self()}.
writeSyncVar(Var, V) ->
  Var!{write, V, self()},
  receive
    written -> ok
  end.

test() ->
  V = newSyncVar(),
  spawn(fun() -> writeSyncVar(V, 42), base:println("done") end),
  timer:sleep(1000),
  Val = readSyncVar(V),
  base:println("Read").
```
