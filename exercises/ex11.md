# Exercise Sheet 11

## Pessimistic STM implementation
- improve the pessimistic STM implementation we did in lecture with:
  - complete `or_else`
  - delay locking of write set TVars to the commit phase
  - suspend rollbacks until locks are released

Points:
- the `or_else` is largely similar to the optimistic `or_else`
  - we run `T1()` and if we catch a `retry`, we need to get the WS and RS after the `retry`
  - we can reset the WS back to WS0, but first we need to unlock all of the TVars we no longer need from the WS
  - unlock WS1 -- WS0 -- RS1
- delay locking of write set TVars to the commit phase
  - here we lock all of the WS TVars before we commit
  - note that we don't need to lock TVars in the WS which have already been locked by the RS
  - also if we can't lock any one of the WS TVars, we need to unlock all of them, and then all of the RS variables as well and try the transaction again
- suspend rollbacks until locks are released
  - in the sample solution, if we try to lock a TVar and it is already locked, we add ourselves to a list of transactions waiting for this TVar to become unlocked again
  - then in the rollack, all we have to do is unlock all our locks and wait for that TVar to become unlocked again, sending us a `continue` message
  - in my implementation, this all happens in `write_tvar` which doesn't make a whole lot of sense, because if we try to read a TVar and it is locked, we should also rollback and wait for that TVar to become available again

## Pessimistic STM for Key-Value-Stores
- here we implement the pessimistic STM using only key value store operations, like in the last exercise
- again, the sample solution used `gb_trees`
- while my solution was clunky, it's actually a similar implementation to the sample solution and I definitely think it reads more easily
- ps, it makes use of erlang macros which are these:

```erl
-define(KEYPOS, 1).
-define(L,locked).
-define(U,unlocked).
```

- here's the key value store process
  - note that `check_val` is a leftover process for validation in a `retry`, where we don't check the version anymore, and instead the direct value


```erl
kvs(Dict) -> 
  receive
    {lookup,K,P}  -> case keyfind(K,?KEYPOS,Dict) of
                       {K,V,?U,S}  -> P!{just, V},
                                      kvs(keystore(K,?KEYPOS,Dict,{K,V,?L,S}));
                       {K,_,?L,_}  -> P!is_locked,
                                      kvs(Dict)
                     end;
    {insert,K,V}  -> case keyfind(K,?KEYPOS,Dict) of
                       false       -> kvs(keystore(K,?KEYPOS,Dict,{K,V,?L,[]}));
                       {K,_,?L,S}  -> map(fun(Susp) -> Susp!restart end, S),
                                      kvs(keystore(K,?KEYPOS,Dict,{K,V,?L,S}))
                     end;

    {delete,K}    -> case keyfind(K,?KEYPOS,Dict) of
                       false       -> kvs(Dict);
                       {K,_,?L,S}  -> map(fun(Susp) -> Susp!restart end, S),
                                      kvs(keydelete(K,?KEYPOS,Dict))
                     end;

    {lock,K,P}    -> case keyfind(K,?KEYPOS,Dict) of
                       {K,V,?U,S}  -> P!locked,
                                      kvs(keystore(K,?KEYPOS,Dict,{K,V,?L,S}));
                       {K,_,?L,_}  -> P!is_locked,
                                      kvs(Dict);
                       false       -> P!doesnt_exist,
                                      kvs(Dict)
                     end;

    {unlock,K}    -> case keyfind(K,?KEYPOS,Dict) of
                       {K,V,_,S}   -> kvs(keystore(K,?KEYPOS,Dict,{K,V,?U,S}))
                     end;

    {check_val,K,Val,P} ->
      case keyfind(K,?KEYPOS,Dict) of
        {K,Val,A,S} -> kvs(keystore(K,?KEYPOS,Dict,{K,Val,A,[P|S]}));
        {K,_,_,_}   -> P!restart,
                       kvs(Dict)
     end
  end.
```

- and, of course, we need to add the DS to everything now too

```erl
lookup(K) ->
  WS = get(ws),
  DS = get(ds),
  case member(K,DS) of
    false ->
      case keyfind(K,?KEYPOS,WS) of
        false   -> RS = get(rs),
                    case keyfind(K,?KEYPOS,RS) of
                      false    -> case core_lookup(K) of
                                   {just,V} -> 
                                       put(rs,keystore(K,?KEYPOS,RS,{K,V})),
                                       V;
                                   is_locked -> throw(rollback)
                                  end;
                      {K,V} -> V
                    end;
        {K,V} -> V
    end;
    true -> throw(error_read_after_delete)
  end.
  
insert(K,V) ->
  DS = get(ds),
  WS = get(ws),
  case member(K,DS) of
    false ->
      case keyfind(K,?KEYPOS,WS) of
        false  -> RS = get(rs),
                    case keyfind(K,?KEYPOS,RS) of
                      false     -> case lock(K) of
                                     doesnt_exist -> ok;
                                     locked    -> ok;
                                     is_locked -> throw(rollback)
                                  end;
                      {K,_} -> ok
                    end;
        {K,_} -> ok
      end;
    
    true -> ok
  end,
  put(ws,keystore(K,?KEYPOS,WS,{K,V})),
  put(ds,delete(K,DS)),
  ok.

delete(K) ->
  DS = get(ds),
  WS = get(ws),
  case member(K,DS) of
    true  -> ok;
    false -> 
      case keyfind(K,?KEYPOS,WS) of
        false  -> RS = get(rs),
                  case keyfind(K,?KEYPOS,RS) of
                    false  -> case lock(K) of 
                                doesnt_exist -> ok;
                                locked -> ok;
                                is_locked -> throw(rollback)
                              end;
                    {K,_}  -> ok
                  end;

        {K,_}  -> ok
      end
  end,
  put(ws,keydelete(K,?KEYPOS,WS)),
  put(ds,[K|DS]).
```

## Bug in optimistic implementation
- consider T1 and T2 are TVars which should ALWAYS contain the same value

```erl
trans1(T1,T2) ->
  V1 = readTVar(T1),
  V2 = readTVar(T2),
  writeTVar(T1,V1+1),
  writeTVar(T2,V2+1).

dangerous(T1,T2) ->
  V1 = readTVar(T1),
  % trans1() commits here! now we are out of sync and will loop forever
  V2 = readTVar(T2),
  case V1 of
    V2 -> ok
    _  -> loop()
  end. 
```

- note that this bug is not present in the pessimistic version because as soon as V1 is read, it is locked
- thus, only either `trans1()` or `dangerous()` can execute at a time
  - there is no concurrency
