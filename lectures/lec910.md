# Lecture 9 and 10

## `chat_server.erl` and `chat_client.erl`
Using erlang nodes to communicate across the internet.

- the problem in the last lecture was that we sent the wrong Pid with the `user_input()` function
- we must pass the pid of the main process before we call `spawn()`
  - ie: `Me = self(), spawn(fun() -> f(Me) end).`

Points:
- a major problem is if one computer crashes, we are still logged in on the server
  - if we log back in, we will see ourselves twice in the list of clients
- to solve this, we will use linking
  - link together two different processes (can be on separate computers)
  - if one of the two processes crashes, the other crashes too
  - however, you can add a flag that instead of crashing if the other process crashes, you get a message


### Linking and trapping in Erlang
```erl
link(CPid)

unlink(CPid)

process_flag(trap_exit, true)
```

When using `trap_exit, true`, make sure that this is located in the process which is NOT crashing! This may have to be within a spawn call.

Concrete example:
```erl
start() ->
  Server_pid = spawn(fun() -> process_flag(trap_exit,true),
                              server([]) end),
  register(chat_server,Server_pid),
  Server_pid.


server(Clients) ->
  ...
  {'EXIT', CPid, _ } -> self() {logout,CPid},
                        server(Clients);
  ...
```

## A serverless chat
- at the moment, we have one server and a number of clients
- instead, we could have clients join the chat but knowing which node another client is on
  - the chatroom is then defined by a set of clients
  - eg. C3 joins by contacting C2
  - they all should be registered with the same name (same atom) on the node where they are located

## TCP Communication
- TCP is a protocol on the transport layer
  - ensures that the packages are delivered properly
  - is connection-based (bidirectional)
  - the order of the packages is kept
  - shares the connection fairly between multiple active connections
- there are two participants on a TCP-Connection
  - server, listens on a fixed port
  - a client may connect to that port, then a connection is established
  - furthermore, you can listen on the same port again and again

### `store_tcp.erl`
Idea: re-implement the key-value store using TCP.

Points:
- start out server listening on a specific port, eg. 65002
  - then start the store,
  - then go into an accept loop which accepts all connections to the store
- accept handler calls the requestHandler, which listens on the socket connection

There are two ways to handle incoming connections from one node:
  - we could also establish a new connection every request
  - client can reuse existing connection
  - also can establish a new one

requestHandler

- receives an incoming message from the socket
- receive `{ok, Packet}`, in our case the packet is a string
  - we parse the string by splitting on the FIRST comma and delete the last newline
- we can then pattern match on the first word
  - for lookup, we send the key to the store for lookup   - pass the message we receive back to the client useing `gen_tcp:send()`
  - don't forget to flush the message with a `"\n"`!

`io_client`
- now takes a Socket instead of the server pid
- also need a `client()` process which will connect to the server and only start `io_client` if successfully connects
- io_client now reads user input, then sends messages over the socket connection to the server
  - it then waits for a reply (if a reply is expected, ie. on a lookup command)

```erl
client() ->
  {ok,Sock} = gen_tcp:connect("localhost", 65002, [list,{packet,line },{active,false}]),
  io_client(Sock).
```

```erl
accept_loop(LSock,Store) ->
  {ok,Sock} = gen_tcp:accept(LSock),
  spawn(fun() -> requestHandler(Sock,Store) end),
  acceptLoop(LSock,Store).

requestHandler(Sock,Store) ->
  gen_tcp:recv(Sock,0) of
    {ok, Str} -> case lists:splitwith(fun(C) -> C/=44 end,
                                      lists:delete(10,Str)) of % split the string on the comma and delete newline at the end
                  {"store",[","|Args]} ->
                  {"lookup",[_|Key]} -> 
                    Store!{lookup,Key,self()},
                    receive
                      {just,V} -> gen_tcp:send(Sock,"{just,"++V++"}\n");
                      nothing -> gen_tcp:send(Sock,"nothing\n")
                    end
```

Note: `store_tcp.erl` does not contain the store code! still need to run it with `store.erl`

#### Erlang tcp `gen_tcp`

```erl
{ok, LSock} = gen_tcp:listen(65002, [list,{packet,line},{reuseaddr,true},{active,false}]) 
% active, false means we can use recv, since usually Erlang
% recv packages come into our mailbox

{ok,Sock} = gen_tcp:accept(LSock)

gen_tcp:recv(Sock,0) of
  {ok,Str} ->
  {error, closed} -> % should close our socket
                     gen_tcp:close(Sock)

gen_tcp:send(Sock,"lookup,"++K)

gen_tcp:close(Sock)
```

### `store_tcp2`
- we change `active,false` to `active,true` (true is the default, so we can simply delete the option all together)
- now we will receive the packets via our mailbox
  - will only be sent to the mailbox of the process which accepts the socket!!!
  - to handle this, we need to put the accept code inside of the requestHandler
  - but then our accept_loop just creates an infinite number of requestHandlers!
  - we need to make the accept_loop sleep, or only spawn a requestHandler on demand
- when we use receive, we need to pattern match:

```erl
receive
  {tcp, Sock, Str} ->
    ...
  {error, Reason} ->
end
```


## How can we implement message passing using tcp in Erlang

- say we have two nodes, n1 and n2
- on n1 we have a process p1
- on n2 we have a process p2
- p1 knows the pid of p2 and wants to send a message to p2
- in the background, p1 needs to connect to the socket on node 2 and send the message to that socket
- p2 cannot directly accept / receive the message because then it could potentially block forever
- thus, we need some intermediate process which handles all incoming messages and sends them to the appropriate process (using internal messaging, ie. `p2!hi`
- two possibilities
  - this one socket only receives messages for p2
  - the socket receives messages for all processes, in which case we need to produce some process identifier for p2, send it as a string. 
    - the representation of p2 on node 1 needs to contain an identifier for p2 on node 2
  - the tcp handler also needs mapping from these identifiers to pids
- the second approach is considered better, since processes are not bounded but the number of ports on a machine is
- in the first approach, the port is the unique identifer of each process
- in the second, we need to differentiate between local and remote pids and encode them
  - thus `p!{hi, self()}` becomes `gen_tcp:send("{hi,{remote_pid, Port#}}")`
- if a local pid leaves the node, it has to be converted into an external representation and we have to guarantee that a `tcp_handler` is running (for ourselves to receive messages)
